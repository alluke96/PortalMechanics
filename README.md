<h1>PortalMechanics</h1>
Portal mechanics just like from Valve's game. Except that I don't have a portal gun... yet. Made in Unity.
I plan to use it in a future Horror based game.

Some of the code credits goes to Brackeys: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQao3hEKfs

I used my FirstPersonTemplate: https://github.com/alluke96/FirstPersonTemplate_forUnity
